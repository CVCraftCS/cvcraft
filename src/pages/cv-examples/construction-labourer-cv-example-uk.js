      intro="Looking for a strong Labourer CV in the UK? This construction labourer CV example shows reliability, site safety awareness, and the ability to follow instructions. UK employers want someone who turns up on time, works hard, works safely, and helps keep the site tidy and organised.

Labourer CV Template (UK format): keep it simple — personal details, a short personal statement, key skills, work history with bullet points, qualifications/tickets (CSCS etc.), and references (or “available on request”).

Tip: if you’ve got a CSCS card, always list it clearly in your qualifications section — it’s one of the first things many site managers look for."
